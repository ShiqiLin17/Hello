# What I am currently working on
🖥️ **Cultured Kids Cuisine:** As a Web Development Intern at Cultured Kids Cuisine, I contributed to building and improving a dynamic, user-friendly website aimed at promoting cultural awareness through culinary education. This experience allowed me to apply my frontend development skills in a real-world environment while collaborating with a diverse and mission-driven team.

# 🧠 Key Things I Learned
**Responsive Web Design**
I gained hands-on experience using CSS media queries and layout techniques to ensure all pages looked and worked properly on devices of various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

**Wireframe to Code Implementation**
I practiced translating Figma wireframes into pixel-perfect React components, strengthening my ability to read and replicate design specifications accurately.

**Git & Version Control**
I worked in a collaborative GitHub environment using branches, commits, and pull requests. I learned to organize code changes cleanly and communicate them effectively through commit messages and documentation.

**Component-Based Design in React**
I deepened my understanding of React by creating and updating reusable components with clean and maintainable code.

**Professional Communication & Team Collaboration**
I regularly collaborated with other interns through Slack, GitHub, and weekly meetings. I learned how to discuss design and code feedback constructively while staying aligned with project goals.

# 🙌 Final Thoughts
This internship strengthened both my technical web development skills and soft skills like time management, attention to detail, and collaboration. I'm proud to have contributed to an organization that uses food and education to bring cultures together, and I'm excited to apply what I learned in future roles.
